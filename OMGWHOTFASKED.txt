who asked the world doesn't revolve around you

"who asked"? the world doesnt revolve around you nor the people. you cant just go "who asked" unless you actually have a reason for it rather than your brainfart stupidity. gosh, you dont even have positive iq levels. its way down negative. so so negative. look at yourself. your family is dissapointed from you. they wanted a son who will grade up and have their life. not someone who will waste their all time on telegram and be a sweaty ass mod. your family wants to de-own you. femboy. trans. go do "cutie" stuff. gosh you dont even have balls to use actual insults that shows how gay you are. go have sex with boys and get pregnant and get boybirth and have babies or something. not like your family cares. not like anyone cares. youre seriously a dissapointment. you should not exist. you should not live. you should die. you are so gay that the world decided to send you to mars to live with elon musk. but guess what? even he rejected you because of how gay you are. he sent you back to the earth and rejected the sex and porn and shit. even elon musk doesnt accept you. even earth doesnt accept you. go to the sun and destroy yourself and never ever emerge, EVER AGAIN.
