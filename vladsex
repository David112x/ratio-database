before i give my last moan, i wanted to tell you that ive slept with gentoo while arch was watching, was it good? was it worth it? yes, it all was. Arch and Ubuntu were just some dirty whores that couldnt even handle my ass. yes, really, with gentoo i felt like in Heaven, felt like a new man, felt like a man who was one of the mafia boss. it was so great, but i still hate that Manjaro had to cooporerate with ubuntu and arch and hunt me, they are still looking for me, they want to cut my dick, could you believe that? but im leaving this note here, incase gentoo will see it, or anyone else, but in short i dont regret my life choices, i never regretted, i was fun while it lasted, my last air and moan ends here, the hunters might kill me at any moment, so of all this said, remember Gentoo that ive always loved you, and Ubuntu and Arch, please fuck off and let me sleep with gentoo even in the other world, thanks. now goodbye!
