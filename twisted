For this list 1 is the least twisted and 10 is the most. If I forgot your favorite twisted clown feel free to "clown" on me in the comments!

Honorable Mention

The Fool (King Lear)- what's twisted about this guy is that he's actually smart and the King is dumb. Makes you think about society and how crazy it is. Gets hung before he can do anything too psycho

1. Pennywise the Clown- ok only reason this guy is not higher on the list is that he is actually a big spider or some shit pretending to be a clown. Makes teenagers gangbang each other in the sewer and find eyeballs in a fortune cookie and stuff

2. Jester (Devil May Cry)- This weirdo does not even care if you shoot bullets at his feet, just dances around and giggles like a fag. Pretty fucked up

3. The Clown With The Tear Away Face- rips his own face off... enough said...

4. Joker (Playing Cards)- No respect for the rules, this guy can make "5 of a kind". Banned from most poker games for his twisted nature

5. Violator - A clown who's also a demon, can't remember if Spawn is a black guy but he might be racist too. Gross and lives in the trash

6. Shaggy 2 Dope- Responsible for creating a whole army of insane clowns. Knows the secrets of the dark carnival

7. Violent J- Slightly higher on the list due to his violent nature

8. John Wayne Gacy- a clown who loved to murder, one of the worst crimes there is. Talk about "dark comedy"

9. The Joker (Batman)- This guy thinks crime is a joke to laugh at. an absolutely twisted psycho who might draw a smilie face on a bullet and shoot you with it. Probably thought he was the most twisted clown of all but...

10. Sweet Tooth- Holy fucking shit, this guy is the most twisted clown of all. Instead of ice cream in his ice cream truck there are missiles and bullets. His head is on fire and he likes to blow up cars. This guy is too twisted to believe
