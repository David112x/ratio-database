I can't find

𝐘𝐔𝐔𝐈𝟒𝐈, [2.03.2023 20:44]
How can I fix this?

Pac-Man Wacka Wacka Wacka...., [2.03.2023 21:12]
Never heard of that app before, but I guess it means you are unsafe because your device is rooted or has its bootloader unlocked

𝐘𝐔𝐔𝐈𝟒𝐈, [2.03.2023 21:13]
Yes it is

Pac-Man Wacka Wacka Wacka...., [2.03.2023 21:14]
In that case you could try hide Magisk from that application or just ignore the message

𝐘𝐔𝐔𝐈𝟒𝐈, [2.03.2023 21:15]
I'm trying to hide it

𝐘𝐔𝐔𝐈𝟒𝐈, [2.03.2023 21:16]
But I don't know what to do with this

Pac-Man Wacka Wacka Wacka...., [2.03.2023 21:21]
Open up Magisk click on the wheel in right corner go to settings  Zygisk make sure it's checked go to enforce Zygisk denylist
Next click on confgure denylist
Add the app to the denylist (Magisk will try to hide from any apps in this list)

Speachy, [2.03.2023 21:21]
hi guys what i need to flash to have iOS  recents?

𝐘𝐔𝐔𝐈𝟒𝐈, [2.03.2023 21:31]


Pac-Man Wacka Wacka Wacka...., [2.03.2023 21:32]
Yep, like that... Does the application still complains?

𝐘𝐔𝐔𝐈𝟒𝐈, [2.03.2023 21:33]
same

Pac-Man Wacka Wacka Wacka...., [2.03.2023 21:33]
(You might try clearing the apps days if it's still complaining)

𝐘𝐔𝐔𝐈𝟒𝐈, [2.03.2023 21:33]
How

Pac-Man Wacka Wacka Wacka...., [2.03.2023 21:39]
Go into settings  applications find your application click on and select manage data...
Some applications also look for Magisk itself...
But I really do not understand what you are really trying to fix here:

Hiding Magisk from that application is not going to make your device more or less secure in any way.
The application just warns you that your device is rooted (or it might be looking for a specific app such as Selinux mod changer or some other app)

𝐘𝐔𝐔𝐈𝟒𝐈, [2.03.2023 21:40]
I uninstalled some apps and its pass 😂

Pac-Man Wacka Wacka Wacka...., [2.03.2023 21:41]
Yep, that can happen

𝐘𝐔𝐔𝐈𝟒𝐈, [2.03.2023 21:42]
I think its from lucky patcher

Pac-Man Wacka Wacka Wacka...., [2.03.2023 21:45]
Yep, that's app is quite disliked by some devs (guess why) 🤪

𝐘𝐔𝐔𝐈𝟒𝐈, [2.03.2023 21:54]
Why !?😳

Pac-Man Wacka Wacka Wacka...., [2.03.2023 21:56]
Because it helps you bypass in-apps payment, and copy protections

𝐘𝐔𝐔𝐈𝟒𝐈, [2.03.2023 21:57]
Oh i know 😂

Pac-Man Wacka Wacka Wacka...., [2.03.2023 21:57]
I guessed that

Pac-Man Wacka Wacka Wacka...., [2.03.2023 22:00]
Personally I think it just results in a nasty spiral myself...
(More app developers will turn to in app purchases as piracy increseas.)
