Using math to calculate how many bitches you get

How many bitches do you get? I derived a formula to calculate the answer to my question. Using the formula:

B = G (A·S) / d²Where:

B: Number of bitches you bring in (BϵN)  
G: Grass constant. The natural logarithm of the number of times you should have touched grass in the past year plus one \[G := ln(350+1)\]  
A: Your age rounded to 2 decimal points  
S: Number of showers you’ve taken this year  
d: Number of days since your father left to go get some milk

As we can see, even if you’ve touched grass and showered daily, your father being gone for more than half a decade (d≥3652.5), the denominator juxtaposes all products on the numerator.

In summary, rounding off B to nearest natural number, we can conclude that you get zero bitches, which is completely unrelatable to all others here, who engage in daily sexual intercourse with all female members of your family above the age of 18 (and trust me, there is no upper boundary – your nan is fair game).
